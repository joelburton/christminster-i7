Include Basic Screen Effects by Emily Short.

Throwing is an action applying to two visible things. Understand "throw [something] at [something]" as throwing.

The player is holding a bag. The bag is a closed openable container. The description of the bag is "A gift from your grandmother, who seems to have thought that no respectable young woman should be seen about town without her crocodile-skin handbag." Understand "handbag", "purse", "crocodile" and "crocodile-skin" as the bag.

A paper is a kind of thing. The telegram is a paper. The map is a paper. A paper can be crumpled or uncrumpled. A paper is usually uncrumpled. The map and the telegram are in the bag.

Instead of examining the uncrumpled map:
	 say "[fixed letter spacing][line break

]".

When play begins:
	say "Foo!";
	Pause the game;
	say "[paragraph break][paragraph break]You haven't seen your brother Malcolm since he received his fellowship at Biblioll College - pressure of work was his excuse not to come down to London. So when you received that telegram from him you leapt at the excuse to come up to the university town of Christminster for the day and visit him.";
	now the right hand status line is "Time: [time of day]"
	
Instead of examining the uncrumpled telegram, say "The telegram reads, 'Dearest Christabel. Work goes well. Amazing discovery in prospect. Come at once. Will tell all when you arrive on Sunday. Your dearest brother, Malcolm Spencer'."

Instead of examining a crumpled paper, say "It's too crumpled to examine."

Instead of jumping, say "[one of]red[or]green[or]blue[then at random]."

Definition: a time is afternoon rather than morning if it is at least 9:10 AM.

	say "There was only one loose stone."

Report going from Chapel Street the first time:

There is a man called a don. He is in Lady Margaret Green. "There is a man sleeping here." The printed name of the don is "man". Understand "sleeping", "man" as the don.

The don is carrying a brass key. [Understand "steal key" as a mistake ("To steal the key, you'll need to do something clever.")
]
Instead of taking the brass key when the don has the key, say "It's attached to him."

Instead of kissing the don, say "This isn't 'Sleeping Beauty'."

Part 3 - Biblioll St



Instead of throwing the stone at something in the presence of the constable, say "You wouldn't aim at [the second noun] with the constable watching."

	say "Foo."
